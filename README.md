# NodeToMySQLSample
This is a starting point for connecting to a MySQL table using Node.js. Can be used for connecting from AWS' Lambda to MySQL RDS. Borrowed heavily from https://redstapler.co/aws-lambda-tutorial-rds-mysql/  . This is the starting point I use for new projects, shared in case it helps anyone else
